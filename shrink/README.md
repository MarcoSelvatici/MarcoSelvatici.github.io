# Shrink!
Shrink is an online file compressor/decompressor that uses Webassembly to manipulate your files:
* __Quickly__: thanks to the underlying zstd compression library implemented in pure C.
* __Locally__: no need to upload your files to a server, you can compress them yourself thanks to WASM!
* __Safely__: your data never leave yuor device.
* __Easily__: just drop them and let WASM do the rest.

If you want to learn more about Webassembly, I wrote a tutorial that will guide you through all the most important concepts and will make you learn how to create amazing and poweful WebApps.
